The Interactive Digital Media Practicum Course is now accepting applications for the Jan-Apr 2019 session. CPSC 491 is a 6-credit course. It's open to UBC undergraduates who meet the eligibility requirements, but students in CS major and minor programs are especially encouraged to apply. Feeback from previous students suggests that it's a pretty awesome experience.
Application deadline: Friday 2018 October 26
